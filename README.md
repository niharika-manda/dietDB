# dietDB
DietDB provides an interactive user interface in which a customer can select different nutrients to be allowed or disallowed, to then generate different possible foods for the customer. Our goal at DietDB is to create a fast and responsive database that takes into account all of your dietary restrictions and helps you find new foods within those same restrictions.
